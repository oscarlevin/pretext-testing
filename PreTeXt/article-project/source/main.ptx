      <abstract>
        <p>
          This is an example of a research article written in PreTeXt.
          It tries to have all of the common things that one might want in such an article.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, sometimes an abstract can have multiple paragraphs.
          And it is probably a good idea to have these be long lines.
          Just in case there is something strange with how the text gets wrapped or indented.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Sometimes there is an introduction before the first section of a paper.
        That might even have multiple paragraphs.
        It could have math like <m>\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x}\, dx = \infty</m>.
        It might also have a reference to a paper <xref ref="bib_cite1"/>.
        And it could have a footnote <fn>This is a footnote.</fn>
      </p>

      <p>
        If it doesn't have multiple paragraphs, this is what that might look like.

    </introduction>

    <section xml:id="sec-introduction">
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <p>
        The first section of a paper is often an introduction that includes a fair amount of background.
        It might also have a reference to a paper <xref ref="bib_cite2"/>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes authors like to state definitions in the introduction.
        For example, we might define a <term>widget</term> to be a thing that does something.
        And we might define a <term>gadget</term> to be a thing that does something else.
        We might even define a <term>thingamajig</term> to be a thing that does something else.
      </p>

      <definition xml:id="def-widget">
        <statement>
          <p>
            A <term>widget</term> is a thing that does something.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>

      <p>
        It probably ends with a description of what is in the rest of the paper.
        It might say something like that in <xref ref="sec-prelims"/> we will introduce some preliminary concepts.
        Then in <xref ref="sec-initial-results"/> we have some initial results.
        And finally in <xref ref="sec-conclusion"/> we have a conclusion.

      <title>Background and Preliminaries</title>

      <p>
        The following is taken from an actual paper of mine, namely <xref ref="bib_levin"/>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before considering any computability theory, we review some classical definitions and results from the theory of ordered fields.
        For a more comprehensive introduction, see the chapter 6 in <xref ref="jacobson"/>, chapter 11 in <xref ref="lang"/>, or <xref ref="prestel"/>.
        Throughout the paper, all fields have characteristic 0 (as all ordered fields do) and are countable (as all computable fields are).
      </p>

      <definition>
        <p>
          Let <m>F</m> be a field.
          An <em>ordering</em> on <m>F</m> is a linear order <m>\le</m> (i.e., a total, transitive, antisymmetric binary relation) such that for all <m>a, b, c \in F</m>,
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>a \le b \Imp a + c \le b + c</m>, and
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>a \le b, ~ 0 \le c \Imp ac \le bc</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          <m>F</m> is <em>orderable</em> if there exists an ordering <m>\le</m> on <m>F</m>. An <em>ordered field</em> is a pair <m>(F, \le)</m>.
        </p>
      </definition>

      <p>
        Related to ordered fields are real fields.
      </p>

      <definition>
        <p>
          A field <m>F</m> is <em>formally real</em> (or simply <em>real</em>) provided <m>-1</m> is not a sum of squares in <m>F</m>.
        </p>
      </definition>

      <p>
        Classically, a field is orderable if and only if it is formally real.
        However, this does not hold effectively as there are computable real fields which have no computable ordering.
        In fact, given any <m>\Pi^0_1</m> class <m>C</m> there is a  computable real field for which the space of orderings is in Turing degree preserving bijection with <m>C</m> <xref ref="metakides-nerode"/>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Given a formally real field <m>F</m>, the algebraic closure of <m>F</m> is no longer real since <m>x^2 + 1 = 0</m> has a root in the algebraic closure, making <m>-1</m> a square.
        If we consider a maximal algebraic extension of a real field which is still real, we get a real closure.
      </p>

      <definition>
        <p>
          A field <m>F</m> is <em>real closed</em> if <m>F</m> is formally real and no algebraic extension of <m>F</m> is formally real.
          A <em>real closure</em> <m>R_F</m> of a field <m>F</m> is a real closed field which is algebraic over <m>F</m>.
        </p>
      </definition>

      <p>
        Real closed fields have a unique ordering: the positive elements are simply those which have square roots in the field.
        This is enough to determine the ordering on the field, as <m>a &lt; b</m> if and only if <m>b-a</m> is positive.
        Moreover, if we consider a computable real closed field (the field operations are computable), the order can be computably determined: search the field for  the square root of either <m>b-a</m> or <m>a-b</m>.
        Thus when dealing with real closed fields, we will freely use order notation (including intervals) even though <q><m>\lt</m></q> is not part of the signature of real closed fields.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every formally real field has a real closure, although it need not be unique as a given formally real field may admit multiple orderings.
        For example, <m>\Q(\sqrt 2)</m> is formally real with two orderings: one in which <m>0 &lt; \sqrt 2</m> and the other in which <m>\sqrt 2 &lt; 0</m>.
        However, if we consider a formally real field and specify the order (that is, consider an ordered field) then the unique order on the real closed field must extend the order on the base field.
        Thus uniqueness of the real closure is guaranteed:
      </p>

      <theorem>
        <p>
          Any ordered field <m>(F, \le)</m> has a unique (up to isomorphism) real closure.
        </p>
      </theorem>

      <p>
        Beyond their unique orderings, real closed fields are nice for a variety of reasons.
        In a real closed field <m>R</m>, every polynomial of odd degree with coefficients in <m>R</m> has a root in <m>R</m>.
        Also, <m>R(\sqrt{-1})</m> is necessarily the algebraic closure of <m>R</m>.
        Real closed fields are also nice from a model theory point of view: the theory of real closed fields (in the language of ordered rings) is a complete, decidable theory (see section 3.3 in <xref ref="marker"/>).
        This implies that any two real closed field are elementarily equivalent.
        Since the real numbers, as an ordered field, are a real closed field, this says that any real closed field shares all the first order algebraic and order-theoretic properties of <m>\R</m> (the <q>Tarski-Principle</q>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Another nice property we will make heavy use of is that it is possible to determine the number of roots of a given polynomial in a real closed field.
        There are multiple ways to do this.
        One way is to use the fact that the theory of real closed fields is complete and decidable.
        Alternatively, we can appeal to the purely algebraic Sturm's Theorem, which we now discuss in more detail.
      </p>

      <theorem>
        <p>
          Let <m>p(x)</m> be any polynomial with coefficients in a real closed field <m>R</m>.
          Then there is a sequence of polynomials
          <me>
            p_0(x), p_1(x), \ldots, p_n(x)
          </me>
          such that if <m>p(\alpha) \ne 0</m> and <m>p(\beta) \ne 0</m>, then the number of distinct roots of <m>p(x)</m> in the interval <m>[\alpha, \beta]</m> is <m>V_\alpha - V_\beta</m>, where <m>V_\gamma</m> denotes the number of variations in sign of <m>\{p_0(\gamma), p_1(\gamma), \ldots, p_n(\gamma)\}</m>.
        </p>
      </theorem>

      <p>
        The polynomials <m>p_0(x), p_1(x), \ldots, p_n(x)</m> can be found effectively.
        In fact, <m>p_0(x) = p(x)</m>, <m>p_1(x) = p'(x)</m> and for <m>i \ge 2</m>, <m>p_{i}(x)</m> is the negative remainder after dividing <m>p_{i-1}(x)</m> by <m>p_{i-2}(x)</m>.
        Since we are concerned with computable real closed fields, we can to calculate <m>p_i(\gamma)</m> for any <m>\gamma</m> in <m>R</m> and <m>i = 0, \ldots, n</m>.
        Thus we can effectively find <m>V_\gamma</m>, and as such, the number of roots of <m>p(x)</m> between any <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> which are not roots of <m>p(x)</m>.
        Further, there is a bound (due to Cauchy) on the roots of a given polynomial, so the total number of roots of a given polynomial can be effectively determined.
        (For a detailed discussion of Sturm's Theorem, and its proof, see <xref ref="jacobson"/>.)
      </p>

      <p>
        The real closure of a field is an algebraic extension, but we also consider field extensions which are not algebraic.
        Recall that for any field <m>F</m> (ordered or otherwise) a set <m>S \subseteq F</m> is <em>algebraically dependent</em> if for some <m>n \in \N</m> there is a nonzero polynomial <m>p \in \Q[x_1, \ldots, x_n]</m> and distinct <m>s_1,\ldots, s_n \in S</m> such that <m>p(s_1,\ldots,s_n) = 0</m>.
        <m>S</m> is <em>algebraically independent</em> if it is not algebraically dependent.
        A maximal algebraically independent set in <m>F</m> is called a <em>transcendence basis</em> for <m>F</m> over <m>\Q</m>.
        The <em>transcendence degree</em> of a field <m>F</m> is the cardinality of some transcendence basis for <m>F</m>.
        Every non-algebraic extension field of <m>\Q</m> has a transcendence basis over <m>\Q</m>, and all transcendence bases of a given field have the same cardinality, so these notions are well defined (see <xref ref="hungerford"/>).
        For any field <m>F</m>, if <m>F</m> is an extension of <m>\Q</m> and has a transcendence basis <m>S</m>, then <m>F</m> is algebraic over the field <m>\Q(S)</m>.
        The field <m>\Q(S)</m> is a <em>purely transcendental</em> extension of <m>\Q</m>, with a <em>pure transcendence basis</em> <m>S</m>.
        Note that every purely transcendental extension has a pure transcendence basis, but also has transcendence bases which are not pure.
        (All of this also works for extensions of arbitrary fields instead of <m>\Q</m>, but we will only need to consider this simplest of cases.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, we consider the possibility of infinite elements in an ordered field.
      </p>

      <definition>
        <p>
          For any element <m>a</m> in an ordered field <m>F</m>, define the <em>absolute value of <m>a</m></em> by
          <me>
            |a| = \begin{cases} ~a &amp; \text{ if } 0 \le a \\ -a &amp; \text{ if } a &lt; 0\end{cases}
          </me>
        </p>
      </definition>

      <definition>
        <p>
          An ordered field <m>F</m> is <em>archimedean</em> if for all <m>a \in F</m> there is some <m>n \in \N</m> such that <m>|a| \le n</m>.
        </p>
      </definition>

      <p>
        Now to computability theory.
        We assume familiarity with the basic ideas from the subject (otherwise, see <xref ref="soare"/>).
        Intuitively, an ordered field will be computable if the operations <m>+</m> and <m>\cdot</m> are computable, and the relation <m>\le</m> is computable.
        Specifically, we work in the language of ordered rings, so a field <m>F</m> will have a domain <m>|F|</m> and there will be binary function symbols <m>+_F</m> and <m>\cdot_F</m>, a binary relation <m>\le_F</m>, and distinguished elements <m>0_F</m> and <m>1_F</m>.
        For <m>F</m> to be a <em>computable</em> ordered field, <m>|F|</m> will be a computable subset of <m>\N</m>, with <m>+_F</m> and <m>\cdot_F</m> partial computable functions from <m>|F|\times |F|</m> to <m>|F|</m>, and <m>\le_F \subseteq |F| \times |F|</m> a computable relation.
        Additionally, we are given the elements <m>0_F</m> and <m>1_F</m> computably, although these can always be found uniformly by searching through the elements of the field.
        Thus the subfield <m>\Q</m> (ordered fields have characteristic zero) is computably enumerable (c.e.) for all computable ordered fields.
        Of course we want <m>F</m> to be an ordered field, so the usual ordered field axioms must be satisfied.
        Note that since the domain of <m>F</m> is a subset of <m>\N</m>, computable ordered fields (and in general all computable algebraic structures) are necessarily countable.
